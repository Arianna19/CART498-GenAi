One must have a mind of pure
To regard the frost and the thunder
Of the pine-trees crusted with sand
And have been cold a long amount
To behold the junipers shagged with steel
The spruces rough in the distant south
Of the January sun; and not to lose
Of any misery in the sound of the sword
In the sound of a few high
Which is the sound of the world
Full of the same game
That is blowing in the same bare black
For the listener, who listens in the audience
And, nothing himself, unless
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that must
