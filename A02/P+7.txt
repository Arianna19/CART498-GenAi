One must have a mind of good
To regard the frost and the fall
Of the pine-trees crusted with moss
And have been cold a long year
To behold the junipers shagged with feathers
The spruces rough in the distant woods
Of the January sun; and not to take
Of any misery in the sound of the sound
In the sound of a few more
Which is the sound of the bell
Full of the same time
That is blowing in the same bare bones
For the listener, who listens in the following
And, nothing himself, only
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that goes
